# Holybean Modpack
The HolyBean modpack is just a "small" modpack put together for the Holybeaners can play!
Just a collection of mods that might seem random, but I promise makes sense to me, lol.

## Mods included
You can find that [here](https://github.com/alexwolfe19/Holybeans-mcmodpack/wiki/Modlist)

## Suggesting Mods and Reporting Issues
If you find a mod conflict (like once I had from updating Create too new for its addons), or have a suggestion for a new mod, texture pack, etc. that should be added to the pack, there's an easy way to do this.
Simply navigate to the [issues page](https://github.com/alexwolfe19/Holybeans-mcmodpack/issues), click on *New Issue*, and there should be a template already setup for reporting relevant issues - if not, please give me some time, and just click the [Open a blank issue](https://github.com/alexwolfe19/Holybeans-mcmodpack/issues/new) button.
